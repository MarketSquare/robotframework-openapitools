# OpenApiTools v1.0.0

## Major changes and new features
- Added a CLI tool for library generation. See the `OpenApiLibGen` documentation for all the details.
- Support for nested `Dtos` in `Relation` constraints [(issue #49)](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-openapitools/issues/49).
- The core logic has been rewritten to use Pydantic models under the hood.
This rewrite has made the addition of the library generator possible and allows feature implementations in future releases that were previously (too) hard to implement.
- The documentation has been restructured / rewritten and should now be much more coherent and accessible.

## Bugfixes
- No specific bugfixes have been made, but the core refactor of the application has solved a number of undocumented issues.

## Breaking changes
- `PathPropertiesConstraint` is now a separate type of `Relation`. See the `Advanced Use` documentation for details.
- In a number of places, the terms `url`, `path` and `endpoint` were not correctly and / or consistently used. This has been corrected.
    - A `url` is a complete url which can be use e.g. in a browser or http request.
    - A `path` is a portion of an `url`.
    In the scope of OpenApiTools, a `path` corresponds to an entry in the paths section of an OpenAPI specification document.
    - From a standards / definition point of view "all endpoints are URLs, not all URLs are endpoints".
    An `endpoint` represents a specific function offered by an API.
    Due to this subtle difference, when the term endpoint is used in the OpenApiTools documentation, it refers to the combination of an `url` and a corresponding HTTP operation / verb as they are found under the path entries in an OpenAPI specification document.
